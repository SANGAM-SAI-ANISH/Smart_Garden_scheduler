# Smart Garden Scheduler

## ðŸŒ± Project Overview
The **Smart Garden Scheduler** is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage and automate their garden watering schedules.  
It provides a **clean and user-friendly UI** for interaction and uses **weather forecasting** to optimize watering times, conserving water and improving plant health.  

The project integrates:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive interface.
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot for handling business logic and scheduling tasks.
- **Weather Forecasting:** External API integration to fetch real-time and forecast weather data.

By analyzing upcoming weather conditions, the scheduler can skip watering on rainy days or adjust schedules during hot, dry periods.
